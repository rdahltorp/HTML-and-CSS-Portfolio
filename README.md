# Bootcamp Challenge 2: Portfolio

## Description

This repo contains the code used to develop my basic portfolio site. 
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

To install and work on the code, clone down the index.html, README.md, and assets folder (containing the images folder and CSS file) to your machine and open in a source code editor.

## Usage

The purpose of this web app is to display finished projects in a readable way as well as provide some additional info on the author including how to get in contact with them. 

When active, the code will look like the following image:
